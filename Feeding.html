<p style="text-align: center;"> Every day I would pass by Friends house. Some days I would see her and some days I wouldn't. And when I did see her she was yelling at me for food which I would gladly feed her. The poor thing... <br> Her backstory is still a mystery for me but I won't turn a blind eye on this sweet heart. </p>
